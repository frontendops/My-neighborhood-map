# Neighborhood Map app

This application uses react, google-maps-react, and foursquare api to create a list
of places that i visit and are popular where i live.

## To Run
download or clone the repository and cd into it with your chosen command line
install npm with `npm install`
then run `npm start`


- when running the app the purple circle in the top left is to open the search menu
there you can search for any listed item and it will filter out the rest.

## Resources
This is what i used to help create this application
