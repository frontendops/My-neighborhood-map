# Neighborhood Map app

This application uses react, google-maps-react, and foursquare api to create a list
of places that i visit and are popular where i live.

## To Run
download or clone the repository and cd into it with your chosen command line
install npm with `npm install`
then run `npm start`

- the app has a service worker resgistered in the production build. to run in production
mode you can use webpack
- when running the app the purple circle in the top left is to open the search menu
